#### Presented at AGU Fall Meeting 2020, San Francisco, CA
Sediment transport and morphology was sucessfully implemented into the 3D wave resolving model SWASH. Sediment transport fluxes are calculated, taking acceleration and velocity skewness into account. The sediment transport of the model was validated using flume data, and it was able to reproduce the bedload correctly. Using this new implementation, we can assess the ability to reproduce onshore sandbar migration observed in measurements. This work primarily focuses on data collected at the Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. The newly implemented sediment transport and morphology feature in SWASH provides a valuable tool that will be used to improve the parameterization of the velocity profile and wave-shape-related sediment transport in wave averaged models such as XBeach and COAWST.
