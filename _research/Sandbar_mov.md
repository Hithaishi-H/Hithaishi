Understanding the response of the beach profile and its shallow features (sandbars) in varying wave climates has important implications for different fields. Modeling the evolution of onahore sandbars is especially challenging due to the complex hydrodynamic processes that drive sediment transport and morphological changes. 
Effect of wave shape have been identified as been importnant in onshore sandbar migration.
