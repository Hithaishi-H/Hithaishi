## Introduction 
 
In this research, the influence of tides on cross-shore sediment dynamics of a longshore-uniform beach was studied by means of a 1D numerical model (XBeach). The model was modified to include longshore tidal currents induced by water level gradients. The effect of tides on cross-shore sediment dynamics was quantified by analyzing the change in suspended sediment concentration, sediment advection velocity, and sediment transport. The effect of tides was decoupled into its two main components, i.e., water level fluctuations and tidal currents.

From this study we fill the gaps found in previous research studies; 
1 Field studies are limited to one or two locations in the cross-shore of a beach. Hence, they do not explain how the influence of tidal currents on sediment dynamic varies along the cross-shore. In addition, these studies are limited to a few wave and tidal conditions.
2 Numerical studies focus only on water level fluctuations and neglect tidal currents. They employ empirical relationships that do not solve the governing hydrodynamic and sediment dynamic equations.  
3 No study has been performed to identify the influence of combined tidal current and water level fluctuations on sediment dynamics over the cross-shore of a beach.  


## Effect of Water level fluctuations

Water level fluctuations modulate wave orbital velocities, wave-averaged currents and sediment advection velocity, therefore affecting both resuspension of sediments and cross-shore sediment transport.

## Effect of tidal currents

Tidal currents favor tidally-averaged sediment resuspension due to the increase in applied shear stress on the bed.

The effects of water level fluctuations and tidal currents on sediment dynamics vary in the cross-shore direction.
Tidal currents increase sediment resuspension in deeper water depth, while water level fluctuations control the changes observed in shallow waters. In shallow waters, tidal amplitude is a good indicator of the influence of longshore propagating tides on the cross-shore sediment dynamics of a uniform beach, while in deeper waters, tidal wavelength also plays an important role. The model predictions are able to capture the trends observed in field measurements.

> Secessionist conflicts often begin in places abundant with resources and located far from the centers of state power. These factors affect the likelihood of secessionist conflict because dissidents will only rebel when they expect to be able to form a functional state within the borders of their territory following independence. There are many regions that meet the necessary conditions for sovereign governance in the world, but few secessionist conflicts. I argue that this relative paucity of secessionist violence is the result of government preemption of potential secessionist movements. Using cross national geospatial data, I find that governments develop higher levels of state capacity in more governable, and thus more secession prone, regions. The same factors which make territory attractive for secession also make governments willing to work to retain control of that territory, suggesting that potential secessionists confront many of the same dilemmas as states.

> Secessionist conflicts are likely to begin in specific types of places: those with abundant resources located far from the centers of state power. These factors affect the likelihood of secessionist conflict because dissidents will only rebel when they expect to be able to form a functional state within the borders of their territory following independence. There is a strong link between oil and secessionist conflict, but oil is far from the only resource a state can rely on. There are many regions that meet the necessary conditions for sovereign governance in the world, but few secessionist conflicts. I argue that this relative paucity of secessionist violence is the result of government preemption of potential secessionist movements. What strategies do governments use to try and preempt secession attempts by aggrieved minorities? What determines when they prefer to employ carrots vs sticks? Finally, what explains why these efforts break down allowing the onset of secessionist conflict? I argue that when discontinuous shifts in the resources available to ethnic groups within territories occur and governments' capabilities to monitor those territories prevent them from quickly updating their information, dissidents capitalize on this private information and initiate conflict. I investigate these dynamics with an agent based model of government surveillance and preemption strategies, studying the effect of exogenous shocks on resources within ethnic group territories on the likelihood of conflict onset. By varying how quickly the government is able to update its information in response to changes in ethnic group territories, I model the effect of government intelligence quality on the likelihood of conflict. These insights are combined with qualitative case study evidence to illustrate how failure in government preemption strategies can lead to secessionist conflict.
